# Going Live

After building and testing your plugin, copy/paste the following application into an email to team@usetrmnl.com.

Subject:&#x20;

```
Public plugin submission - {{ plugin name }}
```

Body:

```
Hi team,

Please review my plugin for the public marketplace:

Plugin ID: {{ visit My Plugins > click Edit, copy integer ID from URL }}
Owner Email: {{ should == inbox from which you are sending this message }}

Why should this plugin be public vs private? How does it help other users?
{{ should be different than your Description field. if your plugin is against our ethos (breeds distraction, not focus), it may be better as an open source + Private plugin. }}

Video demonstration:
{{ link to video, no audio required, of the plugin being installed from scratch. }}

How can we test this plugin works?
{{ preferably a demo login email/password that we can own forever, ex "team@usetrmnl.com" }}

Will you promote TRMNL when this plugin is published? If so, how/where?
{{ no wrong answers, but we prioritize plugins that help us grow }}

Thanks,
{{ your name }}
```

After receiving this information we'll test out your plugin, send revision requests (if applicable), and soft launch it to our Plugins marketplace.

We can then discuss featuring your work in an upcoming email newsletter or other social channels. At any time you are welcome to post it in our developer-only Discord's "#flex" channel, prior to public approval.
