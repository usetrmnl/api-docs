# Introduction

Our plugin marketplace is where developers can make plugins for other users to install. Beginning November 2025 [TRMNL pays developers](https://usetrmnl.com/blog/creator-fund) for their work.

There are 2 approaches to publishing a plugin for other users — Public, or Recipe. Review the differences between them before continuing:

**Recipes** may be built inside the TRMNL interface and do not require any 3rd party dependencies, user auth, etc. To build a Recipe, [start here](https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/9510536-private-plugins). Or browse and install 100s of Recipes here:\

**Public plugins** require a simplified OAuth2 flow. In this scenario, the plugin author (you) maintains user data and is responsible for data privacy and security. TRMNL fetches markup from your server at regular intervals and generates images for the connected user's device to display. To build a Public Plugin, continue reading this guide. Or browse native + public plugins here: [https://usetrmnl.com/integrations](https://usetrmnl.com/integrations)
