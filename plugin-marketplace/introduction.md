# Introduction

Our plugin marketplace is where developers can make plugins for other users to install. Beginning November 2025, [TRMNL pays developers](https://usetrmnl.com/blog/creator-fund) for their work.

There are 2 approaches to publishing a plugin for other users — Public, or Recipe. Review the differences between them before continuing:

**Recipes** may be built inside the TRMNL interface, and do not require any 3rd party dependencies, user auth, etc. Whereas **Public plugins** require the OAuth2 flow. In this scenario, the plugin author (you) maintain user data and are responsible for data privacy and security. TRMNL will fetch markup content at regular intervals and generate an image for the connected user's device to display.
