description: An introduction to running TRMNL on your own hardware.

# Introduction

There are 4 flavors to building the perfect setup for your needs:

1. **Default** - buy our device, that runs our firmware, and pings our server
2. **BYOD** - build your own device, that runs our firmware, and pings our server
3. **BYOD/S** - build your own device, mod our firmware, and ping your own server
4. **BYOS** - buy our device, mod our firmware, and ping your own server (_recommended_)

### Choosing your stack

After starting TRMNL and going down the rabbit hole of DIY smart home, IoT, e-ink, and gadget communities, it became clear that end-to-end ownership, security, and data privacy are critical ingredients to building trust.

With this in mind we decided to [open source our firmware](https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware) and provide [free guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xehPW-PCOM) to reproduce the TRMNL experience _without_ our servers in the middle.

When considering how to build your own e-ink dashboard, it is our opinion that...

* If you're not comfortable with coding, Option #1 is ideal.
* If you're comfortable with high-level programming languages, Option #4 provides an 80/20 approach to privacy + security without breaking the bank or spending hours coding.
* If you have experience in C/C++, or have experience with micro controllers and Python, Option #2 will give you the pride of full control over the look and feel of your peripheral device.
* If you are a l33t programmer or simply have access to AI (half joking), Option #3 is the most comprehensive offering to customize TRMNL however you'd like.

### Prerequisites

Options 1, 3, and 4 are available to all customers for no extra charge.

Option 2 requires a small monthly fee to cover your compute time on our servers, since we don't make any revenue on a device sale.
