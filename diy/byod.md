# BYOD

Before diving into "how," it's worth mentioning that **the investment required to build your own device will be greater than our retail price**.&#x20;

Making your own TRMNL from scratch is not an economically rational decision, but rather a labor of love. Our own team learned this the ~~hard~~ fun way while building v1 over 7 months, from Dec 2023 to July 2024.

Here's what you can expect to spend per component:

* Battery, $5 (unnecessary if you prefer plugged in)
* EPD screen, $65 (see the Waveshare 7.5" on Amazon)
* Microcontroller, $3-50 (depends if you build/solder yourself or leverage a PCB prototyper)
* Enclosure/case, $3-20 (design + 3D print yourself or use a print farm)

If you know what you're doing and just need some firmware or a server client, here ya go:

* Firmware: [https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware](https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware)
* Server (multiple options): [https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/diy/byos](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/diy/byos)

When you're ready to build plugins:

1. Buy access to the TRMNL web app + API: [https://shop.usetrmnl.com/products/byod](https://shop.usetrmnl.com/products/byod)
2. Activate a virtual device: [https://usetrmnl.com/claim-a-device](https://usetrmnl.com/claim-a-device)
3. Plug your TRMNL API key into your DIY device firmware
4. Stay focused
