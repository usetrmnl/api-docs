# BYOD

Before diving into "how," it's worth mentioning that **the investment required to build your own device could be greater than our retail price**.&#x20;

Making your own TRMNL from scratch is not an economically rational decision, but rather a labor of love. We learned this the ~~hard~~ fun way while building v1 over 7 months, from Dec 2023 to July 2024.

Here's what you can expect to spend per component:

* Battery, $5 (unnecessary if you prefer plugged in)
* EPD screen, $50 ([this one](https://amazon.com/dp/B075R69T93/) is compatible)
* Microcontroller, $3-30 (depends if you build/solder yourself or leverage a PCB prototyper)
* Enclosure/case, $3-20 (print [one of ours](https://github.com/usetrmnl/mounts) or design your own)

If you know what you're doing and just need some firmware or a server client, here ya go:

* Firmware: [https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware](https://github.com/usetrmnl/firmware)
* Server (multiple options): [https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/diy/byos](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/diy/byos)

When you're ready to start building:

1. Buy access to the TRMNL web app + API: [https://shop.usetrmnl.com/products/byod](https://shop.usetrmnl.com/products/byod)
2. Create a virtual device: [https://usetrmnl.com/claim-a-device](https://usetrmnl.com/claim-a-device)
3. Register your DIY device's MAC ([find it](https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/10614205-finding-your-trmnl-mac-address)): [https://usetrmnl.com/devices](https://usetrmnl.com/devices) (click yours to edit)
4. Flash our firmware to your DIY device: [easy](https://usetrmnl.com/flash), [advanced](https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/10271569-manually-flash-firmware)
5. Set up your DIY device by turning it on + following the steps to pair WiFi
6. Your DIY device will produce a 6-digit ID; input this inside TRMNL > top-right dropdown > add new device
7. Stay focused
