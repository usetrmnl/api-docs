# Introduction

If you're a company with a custom plugin, TRMNL makes it easy to reward customers with free or discounted devices that arrive pre-connected to your platform.

Example scenario:

1. Acme SaaS has a subscriber dashboard for their email newsletter tool. Acme builds a custom plugin inside TRMNL to showcase this information.
2. Acme wants to gift a free TRMNL device to their top customers. Acme creates coupon codes with the TRMNL Partners API that their customer can use at checkout for X% off their order.
3. When Acme's customer device is shipped, it is associated to their account on Acme's platform. Upon unboxing + WiFi pairing, Acme's customer will see their Acme native dashboard on TRMNL device without any additional setup.
